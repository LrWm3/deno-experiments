# deno-experiments

I experiment with [deno](deno.land).

## Set-up

I added two vscode deno extensions.

- justjavac.vscode-deno
- axetroy.vscode-deno

As per the instructions for 'justjavac.vscode-deno', I enabled the extension for this project by adding a 
'[.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json)' file.

## Implementation

Apparently Deno is browser compatiable. I don't understand exactly what that means.

## Running

Run with the following command.

```bash
deno run src/hello-world.ts
```

Each example has a bash integration test beside it demonstrating how to run the test.

## Testing

The Deno manual contains a section called [Testing](https://deno.land/manual/testing).
